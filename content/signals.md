title: "BIP-119 Signalled Support"
date: 2021-08-00T00:56:54-07:00
---

The following organizations, individuals, or pools have communicated preference
for and intent to support a BIP-119 activation attempt using reasonable
parameters. These "soft signals" are non-binding until an actual concrete proposal
has been formed, but are useful for measuring community consensus. When a concrete proposal
(e.g., parameters, binaries, etc) is launched, signatories on this list **should not** be considered
to be supportive of that particular effort unless noted otherwise.

Open an [issue](https://github.com/jeremyrubin/utxos.org/issues/new) or a [pull
request](https://github.com/JeremyRubin/utxos.org/pulls) on GitHub to modify or
create or modify an entry for you or your organization. All listings have been
individually confirmed by Jeremy Rubin where a statement is either missing
or ambiguous.

The retraction column indicates if support or dissent has changed, as well as
the date of the change, and should be indicated with a new entry. The "For 2022
ST" column indicates general support for the proposal made
[here](https://rubin.io/bitcoin/2022/04/17/next-steps-bip119/).

### Mining Pools

> note: Most miners mine via mining pools, which aggregate hash power to reduce
> variance in mining returns. While individual miners may also express a
> preference for or against a fork, pools serve as a proxy for the sentiment
> amongst their constituent miners, were they to misjudge they might lose
> hashrate.

**Mining percentages were estimated as of October 7th, 2021 from recent data.**
