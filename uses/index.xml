By using OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, a large volume payment processor may aggregate all their payments into a single O(1) transaction for purposes of confirmation. Then, some time later, the payments can be expanded out of that UTXO when the demand for blockspace is decreased.
Without OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, this is still possible to do with Schnorr signatures (even with ECDSA given multiparty schemes).</description></item><item><title>Soft Fork Bets</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/taproot-bet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/taproot-bet/</guid><description>Can we design a contract which allows someone to automatically place a series of bets on if Taproot was active (by spreading the bet over a longer window, you can hedge the total risk if you aren’t sure the exact period it would activate; it also makes the contract more interesting… The diagram above gives a high level overview of the logic we want to implement&amp;hellip;

Various approaches to alleviate this have been proposed, most prominent of which are payment and state channels, sidechains, commit-chains, rollups, and sharding. This work puts forth a novel commit-chain protocol, Bitcoin Clique. It is the first trustless commit-chain that is compatible with all major blockchains, including (an upcoming version of) Bitcoin.
Clique enables a pool of users to pay each other off-chain, i.</description></item><item><title>CTV dramatically improves DLCs</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/dlc-perf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 10:45:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/dlc-perf/</guid><description>The post discusses how OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV) significantly improves the performance of Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) on Bitcoin. It details the current state of DLC protocols, the computational complexities involved, and how CTV can optimize these processes. By using CTV and Taproot, DLCs can reduce computational costs and data exchanges, simplify threshold oracle setups, and eliminate certain multiplications. These improvements make DLC transactions faster and more efficient, even on resource-constrained devices, though with some trade-offs in witness size and transaction distinguishability.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized options</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/options/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2020 10:45:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/options/</guid><description>Trading of bitcoin derivatives is a huge market nowadays. However, all of it occurs on centralized exchanges with large legal &amp;amp; technical risks that require trust in their operators, thus betraying the philosophy of Bitcoin. The protocol presented here enables the creation and redemption of trustless options on the Bitcoin network.
Main protocol Option creation will follow this protocol:
Use an atomic swap to sync these two operations: User pays fee to underwriter Underwriter sends tokenized USD [1] to an address that is encumbered by the script: After X+K blocks: Send to underwriter After X blocks: If spending tx sends Y BTC to underwriter, send to user When the option reaches maturity the user can exercise it by sending a transaction that: Sends BTC to underwriter Spends the UTXO created on step 1 and sends it to the user&amp;rsquo;s wallet If the user doesn&amp;rsquo;t exercise it on time the underwriter can just spend it to itself Reduction of capital requirement As it is, this protocol requires locking 100% of the collateral for as long as the option stays in effect, but it would also be possible to reduce the capital requirement quite substantially by changing the protocol to make the underwriter lock only 30-50% initially and, at option expiration, make it provide the rest of the payment in case the user decides to exercise the option.</description></item><item><title>Drivechains</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/drivechains/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2020 10:45:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/drivechains/</guid><description>Partial Retraction &amp;ndash; Please See Below Drivechain&amp;rsquo;s peg-out mechanism could be implemented at the transaction level through scripts that force the funds being withdrawn from the sidechain to go through a chain of N transactions, each one of these being in a different block. More specifically, this would be implemented by creating N scripts that would contain an integer constant and would only be spendable to another copy of the same script with the constant increased or decreased by one, with the exception of the script where the constant reaches the value N, in which case the UTXO would be spendable only to a specific address provided in the beginning of the process.</description></item><item><title>Batch Channels</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/batch-channels/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:46:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/batch-channels/</guid><description>Using OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY for Channel Factories is similar to the use for Congestion Control, except the leaf nodes should be set up as a channels instead of plain payments. The channel can be between the sender and recipient or a target of recipient&amp;rsquo;s choice. Using an OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, the recipient may even give the sender an address which makes a set of channels unbeknownst to them.
These channels are already time insensitive for setup, as all punishments can be relative timelocked to the actual instantiation.</description></item><item><title>Non Interactive Channels</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/non-interactive-channels/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:46:13 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/non-interactive-channels/</guid><description>Normally, when opening a payment channel, you require participation from both parties to the channel. This is because the Lightning Network uses pre-signed multi-sig type transactions to ensure that a channel can always be exited by either party, before entering.
With OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, it&amp;rsquo;s possible for a single party to construct a channel which either party can exit from without requiring signatures from both parties.
These payment channels can operate in one direction, paying to the channel &amp;ldquo;listener&amp;rdquo; without need for their private key to be online.</description></item><item><title>Trustless Coordination-Free Mining Pools</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/miningpools/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:45:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/miningpools/</guid><description>for more detail on decentralized mining pools in a more recent article read here
In a typical mining pool, miners works together to create a shared block reward. The shared reward is distributed among participants based on difficulty shares, that is, partial work proofs that &amp;ldquo;prove&amp;rdquo; a miner was working on an appropriate block.
An appropriate block pays the reward to the pool operator, who then distributes (less a fee) the rewards to the other miners.</description></item><item><title>Vaults</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/vaults/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:45:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/vaults/</guid><description>When greater security is required for cold storage solutions, there can be default Tapscript paths that move funds from one target to another target.
For example, a cold wallet can be set up where one customer support desk can, without further authorization, move a portion of the funds (using multiple pre-set amounts) into a lukewarm wallet operated by an isolated support desk. The support desk can then issue some funds to a hot wallet, and send the remainder back to cold storage with a similar withdrawal mechanism in place.</description></item><item><title>Safer Hashed Time Locked Contracts (HTLCS) Limits</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/htlcs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:30:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/htlcs/</guid><description>In the Lightning Network protocol, Hashed Time Locked Contracts (HTLCS) are used in the construction of channels. A new HTLC is required per route that the channel is serving in.
In BOLT #2, this maximum number of HTLCs in a channel is hard limited to 483 as the maximum safe size to prevent the transaction from being too large to be valid. Adding more HTLCs would interfere with being able to broadcast and confirm a transaction.</description></item></channel></rss>
