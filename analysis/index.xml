issuers to split up their transaction into send and receive components. See
&lt;a href="https://utxos.org">https://utxos.org&lt;/a> for more information. This is potentially a big benefit
because end users can realize faster confirmations on pending transactions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a concern that CTV would result in higher overall chain utilization
(because of overhead) than existing batching solutions. Ignoring the benefits
that CTV can have for earlier confirmations, it would be bad to introduce a
change to Bitcoin that causes users to be wasteful of chain space.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tax Considerations</title><link>https://utxos.org/analysis/taxes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:41:53 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/analysis/taxes/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss basic tax law around payments, establish an analogy between
OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY and traditional certified cheques, and then discuss the relevant tax
consequences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the &amp;ldquo;legacy&amp;rdquo; financial world, a cheque&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> is commonly used to move funds from
financial institutions in lieu of inconvenient physical cash transfers. To date, Bitcoin has not
needed the concept of a cheque because Bitcoin transactions are direct transfers with no
intermediary, i.e., as cash is to a cheque.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Congestion Simulation</title><link>https://utxos.org/analysis/bip_simulation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 15:48:24 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/analysis/bip_simulation/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>An earlier version of this document used the poission distribution of the average block interval rahter than the exponential, which led to innacurate results. A discussion of this error can be found &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin/status/121361540300123750">here&lt;/a>. The error in the code has been corrected in the following article, but the diagrams still need to be re-generated.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The below simulation results show that OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY is an effective too to
reduce network strain in Bitcoin. This is based on the same simulation used in the BIP.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #48</title><link>https://utxos.org/analysis/optech/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 17:31:05 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/analysis/optech/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This article was orignally featured in Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #48, and has been
excerpted, abbridged, and updated slightly for accuracy with the most recent iteration of
the BIP for this page. The original OpTech content may be found

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bips/blob/op-secure-the-bag-master/bip-secure-the-bag.mediawiki">proposed&lt;/a> opcode &lt;code>OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY&lt;/code> allows an address to commit to one or more branches that require the
transaction spending them to include a certain set of outputs, a
technique that contract protocol researchers call a &lt;em>covenant&lt;/em>.
The primary described benefit of this proposed opcode is allowing a
small transaction to be confirmed now (when fees might be high) and have that transaction
trustlessly guarantee that a set of people will receive their actual
payments later when fees might be lower. This can make it much more
economical for organizations that already implement techniques such as
&lt;a href="https://github.com/bitcoinops/scaling-book/blob/master/x.payment_batching/payment_batching.md">payment batching&lt;/a> to handle sudden fee spikes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
